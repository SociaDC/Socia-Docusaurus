# 113 - Commit size

This spec is used to define in what frequency and size commits should be created.

One singular commit as it is built should be sized as small as possible. As smaller the change, the easier it is to track or revert afterwards.
Moreower the history becomes more clear in the eye of other team members.

In our case commits do **NOT** have a preset size as this would only give room for mistakes, but should include implementetions from to seperated Functionalities. 
This includes seperated classes that do not have anything in common, but also functions tht do not serve the same purpose.

Test cases can be included with the implementation of the functionality but it is not required!
