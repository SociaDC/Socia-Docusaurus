# 131 - Branching strategy

Our branches are seperated in the mandatory stationary branches "master/dev" as well as our feature and bugfix branches to initiate change.
Change is never commit on top of the stationary branches and rather "pulled" in.

When developing a Feature the worflow would look as follows:

Feature is done -> PR from Feature Branch to Dev -> PR is merged -> PR from Dev to Master -> PR is merged.

This workflow is simplifying the overall process a little bit, because dev is used as our development branch where you could see it as "TRUNK based" because we try to get change to dev as fast as possible.
It represents the actual development state of our software and has to be buildable but not Production ready.

Master on the otherhand is primarily used as our production branch where software only belongs to after a successfull sprint.
