# 201 - Testing Pipeline

The testing pipeline is defined as the process to determine the flow of tests and in which order they are written as well as executed.

This has to be seperated in Frontend and Backend tests as they differ from each other and do not cross each others path (segregated execution and functionality)

Concept : TDD

### Frontend Testing Pipeline

1. Unit 

At first you will test the pages functionality at its core, therefore any methods have to be tested as a seperated unit.

2. E2E (Cypress Tests)

The cypress tests are used to test our whole applications stack.
(Requires Running Backend)
Cypress is used to mock a users behaviour such as typing or click events and therefore expects a response from the page.

### Backend Testing Pipeline

1. Unit
2. Property test (Generalized unit test)
3. Architecture tests
4. Integration tests

### Workflow

Define Spec of your narrowed down feature
Define Test 

- For Frontend that would mean defining your cucumber spec (In natural language)
- For Backend functionality that would mean defining your "unit" test case before starting to implement the functionality

This Process requires you to think about your functionalities outcome in a more detailed manner!
