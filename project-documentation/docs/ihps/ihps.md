# IHPS (In House Project Standarts)
---
Author : Philipp Cserich

Date : 18.10.2024

The IHPS standarts are built to represent common standarts used in the everyday work of every programmer in our organization.
They should always return some type of benefit for the projects workflows and new additions will be voted in or out at the next commonly occuring sprint meeting.
IHPS or In House Project Standarts are therefore required to be beneficial in either standartization and understandability or creating faster response flows and minimzing workloads.


## Standart

The organizational Standarts are procedurally built by using this exact versioning system :

IHPS-[Unit]-[ID]

> Unit x ID are both 3 Digit codes

Example

> IHPS-100-001

-> IHPS-110-001 (Git Commit convention with the index "1")
