## Build Checks

The Projects Build checks can be defined through several steps only resulting in one goal -> the exection of the Project
This mostly means that a project has predefined checks such as building requirements that get triggert throught a so called CI (Continous Integration) Pipeline.
The Pipeline automates the process of checking whether or not those predefined requirements are met.

All APs are only Accepted if they are on the development branch before the Sprint meeting starts.
